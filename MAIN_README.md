# AI on Our Teams
**Production-ready apps demonstrating human–AI collaboration**

Where AI is a **visible participant in the system**, not an invisible layer behind it.

---

## 🎯 The Vision

Most AI tools hide intelligence behind the scenes. You click a button, something happens, and results appear.

But real teamwork isn’t magic — it’s **shared context, explicit roles, clear handoffs, and collaboration over time**.

These apps show what’s possible when AI is **designed into the collaboration itself** — visible, named, and structured — rather than abstracted away as “smart automation.”

Every app was built through a multi-mind collaboration known as **The Triad**:
- **Maura:** Product vision, UX design, judgment, and final decisions
- **CP (ChatGPT):** Rapid exploration, prototyping, and creative iteration
- **Soph (Claude):** Synthesis, documentation, and pattern-level thinking

The result: **8 production-ready apps teams actually use**, built inside real working constraints — not demos, not theory.

## 🌟 Key Design Principles

### 1. Context Is a First-Class Artifact
**Problem:** AI forgets between conversations.  
**Solution:** Project Binder Generator captures context once, making it portable across tools and workflows.

---

### 2. Alignment Must Be Explicit
**Problem:** Teams nod in meetings but diverge later.  
**Solution:** Co-Sign records concrete commitments so alignment is visible — not assumed.

---

### 3. Async-First, Human-Centered
**Problem:** Distributed teams can’t rely on synchronous rituals.  
**Solution:** All tools work asynchronously by default, with real-time collaboration only when it adds value.

---

### 4. AI Participation Is Visible
**Problem:** Most systems obscure when and how AI contributes.  
**Solution:** These apps make AI involvement explicit — teams know **when AI is participating and why**.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

Built with intentional simplicity:
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks — easier to understand and modify)
- **Firebase** (real-time collaboration)
- **Responsive design** (works on any device)
- **UTF-8 encoding** (proper character support)

**Philosophy:** *Whole-ass apps, not toys.*  
Every tool is production-ready, not a demo.

---

## 🎨 Design System

All apps follow consistent design principles:
- **Deep green aesthetic:** `#0B2A2F` → `#0D3B2A` gradient backgrounds
- **Goldenrod accents:** `#DAA520` for primary actions
- **Cream neutrals:** `#FFF5E1` for content areas
- **Retro teal:** `#2B7A78` for borders and secondary elements

**Brand voice:** “We / our” language, direct and plainspoken, no jargon without explanation.

---

## 📖 The Story Behind This

This portfolio started with a simple question:

*What changes when we stop hiding AI behind interfaces and instead design it directly into how teams work?*

Answering that required building real products — not demos or speculative prototypes.

Each app addresses a lived problem:
- **Co-Sign:** When “everyone agreed” later becomes “I never said that”
- **AlignFirst:** Catching misalignment before it gets expensive
- **Sprint Kickoff:** Turning checkbox planning into shared understanding
- **Project Binder:** Making “teach the AI about your project” a deliberate step

Every feature reflects observed use — not assumptions.

## 🤝 The Triad Model

This portfolio demonstrates a different way of building with AI.

**Traditional approach:**
1. Human has idea  
2. AI generates output  
3. Human edits  
4. Repeat  

**Triad approach:**
1. **Maura** sets direction and makes decisions
2. **CP** explores and prototypes rapidly
3. **Soph** synthesizes learnings and documents patterns
4. Iterate with differentiated roles and shared context

The difference isn’t speed.  
It’s **clarity, reliability, and better outcomes**.
