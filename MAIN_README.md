# AI on Our Teams
**Production-ready apps demonstrating human-AI collaboration**

Where AI is a visible teammate, not an invisible tool.

---

## 🎯 The Vision

Most AI tools hide their intelligence behind the scenes. You click a button, magic happens, you get results. But real teamwork isn't magic — it's communication, context, and collaboration.

These apps show what's possible when we treat AI as a **visible teammate** instead of an invisible tool. Every app was built collaboratively by "The Triad":
- **Maura:** Product vision, UX design, strategic decisions
- **CP (ChatGPT):** Creative spark, rapid prototyping, technical iteration
- **Soph (Claude):** Synthesis, documentation, strategic thinking

The result: 8 production apps that teams actually use, built through genuine human-AI collaboration.

## 🌟 Key Innovations

### 1. Context Is Everything
**Problem:** AI forgets everything between conversations.  
**Solution:** Project Binder Generator captures team context once, making it portable across tools and conversations.

### 2. Solving the "Crickets Problem"
**Problem:** Teams nod in meetings but disagree later.  
**Solution:** Co-Sign gets line-by-line commitments, so you know exactly who agreed to what.

### 3. Async-First Ceremonies
**Problem:** Distributed teams can't gather for every ritual.  
**Solution:** All tools work asynchronously across time zones, with real-time collaboration when it makes sense.

### 4. AI as Visible Teammate
**Problem:** Most AI tools hide how they work.  
**Solution:** These apps make AI participation explicit — you know when AI is helping and what role it's playing.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

Built with intentional simplicity:
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks — easier to understand and modify)
- **Firebase** (real-time collaboration)
- **Responsive design** (works on any device)
- **UTF-8 encoding** (proper character support)

**Philosophy:** "Whole-ass apps, not toys." Every tool is production-ready, not a demo.

---

## 🎨 Design System

All apps follow consistent design principles:
- **Deep green aesthetic:** `#0B2A2F` → `#0D3B2A` gradient backgrounds
- **Goldenrod accents:** `#DAA520` for primary actions
- **Cream neutrals:** `#FFF5E1` for content areas
- **Retro teal:** `#2B7A78` for borders and secondary elements

**Brand voice:** "We/our" language (teaching), direct and honest, no jargon unless you define it first.

## 📖 The Story Behind This

This portfolio started with a simple question: *"What if we stopped treating AI like a tool and started treating it like a teammate?"*

The answer required building actual products — not demos, not prototypes, but tools teams would genuinely use. Each app solved a real problem Maura experienced:
- **Co-Sign:** Tired of "everyone agreed" turning into "I never said that"
- **AlignFirst:** Catching misalignment before it gets expensive
- **Sprint Kickoff:** Turning checkbox planning into genuine shared understanding
- **Project Binder:** Making "teach AI about your project" a first-class activity

Every feature reflects lessons from actual usage, not assumptions about what users might want.

## 🤝 The Triad Model

This portfolio demonstrates a new way of building with AI:

**Traditional approach:**
1. Human has idea
2. AI generates code
3. Human reviews/edits
4. Repeat

**The Triad approach:**
1. **Maura** sets vision and makes decisions
2. **CP** prototypes rapidly and explores creative solutions
3. **Soph** synthesizes learnings and documents patterns
4. Iterate with genuine collaboration, not just delegation

The difference: Each AI teammate has specific strengths, and Maura acts as "message bus" carrying context between conversations. The result is better than any of us could create alone.
