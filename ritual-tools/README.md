# Ritual Tools
**Structured ceremonies for team alignment and decision-making**

## Purpose
These apps provide structure for important team rituals — the moments that need more than casual conversation but less than heavy process. Use them for sprint kickoffs, decision tracking, alignment verification, and project context documentation.

### ✓ [Co-Sign](https://maurakrandall.github.io/ritual-tools/co-sign.html)
**Lightweight commitment tracking for team decisions**

Get clear sign-off line-by-line, with friendly accountability that actually sticks. Perfect for:
- Product roadmap commitments
- Sprint goals and milestones
- Cross-functional agreements
- Avoiding the "crickets problem" where teams give casual nods but later claim they never agreed

**How it works:** 
1. Creator lists commitments line-by-line
2. Team members respond to each: "I'm in" / "Need more info" / "Can't commit"
3. Dashboard shows exactly who's committed, who has questions, and what's blocking people

**Key innovation:** Solves the problem where everyone seems aligned in the moment, but you discover disagreement later. Co-Sign creates specific, trackable commitments.

### ⚖️ [AlignFirst](https://maurakrandall.github.io/ritual-tools/align-first.html)
**Verify team alignment before moving forward**

Make sure everyone's on the same page before committing resources. Perfect for:
- Before starting new initiatives
- When assumptions feel shaky
- After strategy shifts
- Preventing misalignment from compounding

**How it works:**
1. State the decision or direction
2. Team rates alignment 1-10
3. Low scorers explain gaps
4. Team addresses concerns before proceeding

**Key innovation:** Catches misalignment BEFORE it becomes expensive. Better to spend 10 minutes aligning now than 10 weeks building the wrong thing.

### 🚀 [Sprint Kickoff](https://maurakrandall.github.io/ritual-tools/sprint-kickoff.html)
**Start strong with clear goals and team alignment**

Transform sprint planning from checkbox exercise to genuine alignment. Perfect for:
- Starting new sprints
- Quarterly planning
- Project kickoffs
- Any time you need clear shared goals

**How it works:**
1. Set sprint goals and success criteria
2. Import team context (optional)
3. Team reviews and commits
4. Dashboard tracks progress

**Key innovation:** Combines goal-setting with commitment-tracking. Everyone knows not just WHAT we're doing, but WHO's doing WHAT and WHY it matters.

### 📚 [Project Binder Generator](https://maurakrandall.github.io/ritual-tools/project-binder-generator.html)
**Create comprehensive project context for AI collaboration**

Document everything AI needs to be a useful teammate on your project. Perfect for:
- Starting new AI collaborations
- Onboarding AI to existing projects
- Creating portable context across tools
- Teaching AI your team's voice and values

**How it works:**
1. Answer structured questions about your project
2. Define team roles and communication style
3. Document constraints and success criteria
4. Export as markdown for any AI tool

**Key innovation:** Treats "teaching AI about your project" as a first-class activity, not an afterthought. The binder becomes living documentation that humans AND AI can reference.

## Design Philosophy

All Ritual Tools follow these principles:
- **Ceremony without bureaucracy:** Structure that helps, not hinders
- **Explicit > implicit:** Make assumptions visible
- **Async-first, sync-optional:** Work across time zones
- **Context is everything:** Capture and carry forward what matters
- **Human-AI collaboration:** Design for teams that include AI

## The "Crickets Problem"

Many teams experience this pattern:
1. Present an idea in a meeting
2. Everyone nods
3. Later, discover people had concerns but didn't speak up
4. OR people genuinely thought they agreed but had different mental models

**Ritual Tools solve this by:**
- Making commitments explicit and line-by-line
- Creating safe space for questions and concerns
- Documenting WHO committed to WHAT
- Showing gaps in alignment BEFORE they become expensive
