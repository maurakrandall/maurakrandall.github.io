# Reflection Tools
**Personal introspection and growth tracking**

## Purpose
These apps help individuals navigate burnout, reflect on career decisions, and track personal development. Unlike team-focused tools, Reflection Tools are deeply personal and support individual well-being.

## Apps in This Category

### 🌱 Burnout Buddy *(Coming Soon)*
**Navigate burnout with compassion and practical guidance**

A supportive companion for recognizing and recovering from burnout. Perfect for:
- When work feels overwhelming
- Recognizing early warning signs
- Creating recovery plans
- Building sustainable work habits

**Status:** Currently being built in a separate Claude project. Will be added here when complete.

**Key innovation:** Treats burnout as a normal part of work, not a personal failing. Provides practical tools without judgment.

---

## Future Additions

The Reflection Tools category will grow to include:
- **Career Compass:** Navigate career decisions with clarity
- **Energy Audit:** Track what drains and energizes you
- **Growth Journal:** Structured reflection on leadership development
- **Values Check:** Assess alignment between work and values

---

## Design Philosophy

All Reflection Tools follow these principles:
- **Judgment-free:** No "should" statements, no guilt
- **Action-oriented:** Insights without action plans don't help
- **Privacy-first:** Your data stays yours
- **Compassionate:** Personal growth is hard enough without harsh self-criticism
- **Realistic:** Small sustainable changes beat dramatic transformations

---

## Why Reflection Tools Matter

Team tools (Connection and Ritual) help groups work better together. But individuals need space for:
- **Honest self-assessment** without team dynamics
- **Personal growth** that isn't tied to team goals
- **Recovery** from burnout before it affects the team
- **Career decisions** that might conflict with current role

Reflection Tools create that private space for individual growth.

## 🤝 Built by The Triad

These apps were built collaboratively by The Triad — one human working with two AI teammates, each with distinct roles and strengths:

- **Maura** - Product vision, UX design, emotional architecture
- **CP (ChatGPT)** - Technical structure, system logic, rapid prototyping
- **Soph (Claude)** - Content drafting, narrative flow, strategic synthesis

This isn't "AI-assisted" work — it's true collaboration. Each teammate brings unique capabilities, and the work is better because of the diversity of thought.
