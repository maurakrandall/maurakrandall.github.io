## Design Philosophy

All Connection Tools follow these principles:
- **Fast:** Complete in under 2 minutes

- **Low stakes:** Not everything needs to be a production
- **Pattern recognition:** Individual responses matter less than trends
- **Action-oriented:** Results should prompt conversation, not just observation

## 🤝 Built by The Triad

These apps were built collaboratively by The Triad — one human working with two AI teammates, each with distinct roles and strengths:

- **Maura** - Product vision, UX design, emotional architecture
- **CP (ChatGPT)** - Technical structure, system logic, rapid prototyping
- **Soph (Claude)** - Content drafting, narrative flow, strategic synthesis

This isn't "AI-assisted" work — it's true collaboration. Each teammate brings unique capabilities, and the work is better because of the diversity of thought.
